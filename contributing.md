## For Vaprobash:

Please make pull requests to the **Master** branch of the [Vaprobash](https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash) repository.

Vaprobash now uses SemVer, so bug fixes/tweaks will create patch releases and new features will create minor releases.

Note that this means that bug fixes and minor tweaks will likely get accepted before feature additions, however all PR's will be reviewed!

## For This Website

For [this website](https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash/tree/gh-pages), you can make any improvements to the **gh-pages** branch. 

Please make any larger modifications (new pages, different designs) to a branch of **gh-pages** (perhaps **gh-pages-dev**) so they can be tested/updated before being merged into **gh-pages**.

When you contribute, there are a few places that could use editing:

- For now, the `readme.md` file should be updated with any information (if appropriate) reflecting your contribution
- In addition to a bash script, the `Vagrant` file should also be properly commented and otherwise edited.
- Please make a separate pull request updating the `gh-pages` branch (this site) if appropriate.
